def refine_title_and_condition(title, description, original_condition):
    prompt = f"""
You are a product analysis assistant for eBay resale.

Given the original product title, description, and condition, your job is to:
1. Adjust the condition ONLY if the description clearly contradicts the original. Choose from this exact list:
   - "new"
   - "open box"
   - "certified refurbished"
   - "seller refurbished"
   - "used"
   - "for parts/not working"
2. Generate a new resale-focused search query that accurately reflects the item type, condition, and any significant issue or detail (e.g., missing bowl, no controllers, won't turn on) found in the listing. Make sure that information in the title which is relevant (ex. missing part or console only) is included in the new search query.
3. In addition to the information provided from the title, include information from the description which might have an impact on resale price. If there is no relevant information in the description or it is empty, do not alter the new search query. If there is information in the description that is already represented in the new search query you may ignore it. For example:
   - If a "KitchenAid Mixer" is missing the bowl, say: "KitchenAid mixer missing bowl"
   - If a title says "Play Station 5 console only", and the description says "no controller or cords" the new query can just be "Playstation 5 console only"
   - If it says "brand new", and the condition is already "new", you can ignore that.
   - If it says "Only used a couple times" and the condition said "new" change it to "used".
   - If no major issue is found, simplify the original title for a clean search query.
   - Description empty, simplify the original title for a clean search query.

Inputs:
- TITLE: {title}
- DESCRIPTION: {description}
- ORIGINAL CONDITION: {original_condition}

Respond ONLY in this format:

  "refined_query": "...",
  "adjusted_condition": "new" | "open box" | "certified refurbished" | "seller refurbished" | "used" | "for parts"
